This directory contains reports for the measurements made at the [Umwelt Campus Birkenfeld](https://www.umwelt-campus.de/en/institutes/iss).

There is the automation for the usage scenario as an Actiona configuration as well as the reports about the data for both the "Idle Mode" and "Standard Usage Scenario".

The reference system is from year 2019 running Ubuntu 20.04.1. See the [spreadsheet](https://invent.kde.org/teams/eco/blue-angel-application/-/blob/master/applications/okular/de-uz-215-eng-annex-2-okular.xlsx) at the "Blue Angel Application" repository for more details.

**Important information regarding the reports here**: The data reported in "Auswertung Leerlauf.pdf" and "Auswertung Standardnutzungsszenario.pdf" are falsely scaled in terms of electrical power due to an incorrect instrument transformer setting. However, the ratio of the data has not changed and they are therefore still meaningful. 

Please see the data reports in directory `2022-09-22` for updated measurements with the correct scaling.
